# randomised-algorithms


This repo will mainly contain my attempts to solve the homeworks of the course **Randomised Algorithms**, that I'm undertaken at the **university of PASSAU**.

As we always get some feedback from the Professor, I'll try to add below points that I have missed, or questions that I got completely wrong:

### Homework 6:
**Mark: 19/20**


### Homework 5:
**Mark: 20/20**

I made a mistake that got me a point in Exercise 2, $E[X_t - X_{t+1} | X_t = s]$ is equal to 1/5 and not 1. And there was a bonus question of 2 points, I got half the prize :p.

### Homework 4:
**Mark: 17/20**

I missed a few points, mostly by being "sloppy" and rushing my conclusions, I should've been more precise.
### Homework 3:
**Mark: 20/20**

Nothing much to add. Exercise, the upper bound is acceptable, but a bit too excessive.

### Homework 2:
**Mark: 20/20**

Nothing much to add, besides the last exercise, I heavily relied on combinatorics.

### Homework 1:
**Mark: 18/20**

Remark: I missed a few details that cost me the 2 points
* In Ex1 (b), I didn't notice that $p \neq 1$
* I should've adressed the protocol in exercise 2 in more details.
