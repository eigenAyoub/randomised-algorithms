# randomised-algorithms


This repo will mainly contain my attempts to solve the homeworks of the course **Randomised algorithms**, that I'm undertaken at the **university of PASSAU**.

As we always get some feedback from the Professor, I'll try to add below points that I have missed, or questions that I got completely wrong:


### Homework 2:
**Mark: 20/20**

Nothing much to add, besides the last exercise, I heavily relied on combinatorics.

### Homework 1:
**Mark: 18/20**

Remark: I missed a few details that cost me the 2 points
* In Ex1 (b), $p \neq 1$
* I should've adressed the protocol in exercise 2 in more details.
